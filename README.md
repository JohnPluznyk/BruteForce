# BruteForce
Simple brute force atttack in c.

The code in this repository is for a simple brute force attack that I made.  Basically in order for the code to work
you have to specify the word you are testing and the size of the word.  From there the code will try every single possible combination with
the amount of specified characters that the user has entered.  This is ultimtaely just a start to a project and to show that I am active on github.
